      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p style="width: 161px; margin: 0px 5px 20px 15px; float: right; display: inline;">

      </p>
      <p>Born in January 1990, I'm twenty years old, and I live in Oxford, England. Personal interests include gaming, computers (servers/coding/etc), film/tv, events, comedy and classical music.</p>
      <p>I'm a consultant who dabbles in a number of areas, including project and brand management, public relations, advertising campaigns, publishing and event management - and my work is mostly in the video games industry.</p>
      <p>I currently hold a full-time position with UK-based media company Heaven Media as Operations Manager, which gives me a wide range of responsibilities (pretty much all the areas I specialise in!) However I do still find time to freelance now and then, which helps keep my life nice and varied.</p>
      <p>Heaven Media websites have over 1.6 million unique readers per month (ABC\ComScore audited), with over 500,000 registered user accounts, and over 60,000 user comments a month. As well as the editorial side of our business, looking after all the websites, we specialise in providing bespoke advertising campaigns for companies including Dell, Intel, NVIDIA and many more, banner advertising, and we are also known for being the company behind the 10,000sqft Game Zone at Gadget Show Live each year (60,000+ visitors).</p>
      <p>Now and then you can find my columns on Cadred.org (in 2009 my writing was awarded an Esports Award by Turtle Entertainment), and you can see me every so often doing freelance on-camera work for QuadV and ESL TV.</p>
      <p>I absolutely love to travel, so it's great that, as part of my work for various companies (Heaven Media more often than not), I've had plenty of excuses to get around... particularly enjoyable trips in the past few years include a couple of hot summers in Denmark, a very very cold winter in Finland, a crazy trip to China (during which I was quarantined for an illness I didn't have, and also bribed a customs officer), as well as numerous visits to countries including France, Germany and Belgium.</p>
      <p>I've been interested in servers, software, websites, code and so on for about a decade, and currently have a number of personal dedicated servers, partly to host a few different things, but also because I simply enjoy playing around with them.</p>
      <p>While the majority of my job for Heaven Media revolves around advertising, project management and other business-orientated areas, I do play quite a hands-on roll in the management of our webservers, fitting in neatly as a link between our technical staff and our editorial staff, knowing both sides of the operation  well. We have quite a few hefty quad-core Xeons running Windows Server 2008, a bunch of servers running Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, and a couple running OpenSolaris, with software spanning IIS, Apache, Cherokee, Nginx, PHP, RoR, MySQL, PostgreSQL and more, so that keeps me both interested and busy!</p>
