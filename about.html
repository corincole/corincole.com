      <h1>About Me</h1>

      </p>
      <p>Born in January 1990, I'm twenty-two years old, and I live in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire (in the UK). Personal interests include travel, classical music, gaming, technology/etc, film/tv and sport (before becoming lazy and unfit, I loved playing football and squash, now I support Oxford United, Arsenal (football) and the LA Dodgers (baseball) while getting lazier and less fit).</p>
      <p>I'm a consultant who dabbles in a number of areas, including project and brand management, public relations, advertising campaigns, publishing and event management - and my work is mostly in the video games and computing industry.</p>
      <p>I currently hold a full-time position with UK-based media company Heaven Media as Operations Manager, which gives me a wide range of responsibilities, meaning I'm <strike>never</strike> rarely bored. However I do still find time to freelance now and then, which helps keep my life nice and varied.</p>
      <p>Heaven Media websites have over 1.6 million unique readers per month (ABC\ComScore audited), with over 600,000 registered user accounts, and over 65,000 user comments a month. As well as the editorial side of our business, looking after all the websites, we specialise in banner advertising and providing bespoke advertising campaigns for companies including Dell, Intel, NVIDIA and many more. We are also known for being the company behind the Game Zone at Gadget Show Live each year (pretty small in 2009, 10,000sqft with 60,000+ visitors in 2010, and 53,000sqft with 100,000+ visitors in 2011), and a few smaller events.</p>
      <p>Now and then you can find my columns on Cadred.org (in 2009 my writing was given an award by Turtle Entertainment), and you can see me every so often doing freelance on-camera work for QuadV and ESL TV.</p>
      <p>I absolutely love to travel, so it's great that, as part of my work for various companies (Heaven Media more often than not), I've had plenty of excuses to get around... particularly enjoyable trips in the past few years include a couple of hot summers in Denmark, a very very cold winter in Finland, a crazy trip to China (during which I was quarantined for an illness I didn't have, and also bribed a customs officer), as well as numerous visits to countries including France, Germany and Belgium. I keep a list of places I've visited <a href="http://misc.corincole.com/places_visited.txt" title="places_visited.txt">here</a>.</p>
      <p>I also think of Los Angeles as an honorary second home, even if I don't spend nearly as much time out there as I would like. Sadly I don't get too many excuses to get out there for work, but that doesn't stop me buggering off to see a few Dodgers games now and then...</p>
      <p>I've been interested in servers, software, websites, code and so on for about a decade, and currently have a number of personal dedicated servers, partly to host a few different things, but mainly because I simply enjoy playing around with them.</p>
      <p>While the majority of my job for Heaven Media revolves around advertising, project management and other business-orientated areas, I do play quite a hands-on roll in the management of our webservers, fitting in neatly as a link between our technical staff and our editorial staff, knowing both sides of the operation  well. We have quite a few hefty quad-core Xeons running Windows Server 2008, a bunch of servers running Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, and a couple running OpenSolaris, with software spanning IIS, Apache, Cherokee, Nginx, PHP, RoR, MySQL, PostgreSQL and more, so that helps me keep sharp, even if it's not really in my job description.</p>
      <p>I've done some pretty interesting stuff in my life, and perhaps one day I'll write about my past on this site... or maybe I won't, I'm not sure. I just know I'm not ready to write about it today, and probably won't be tomorrow.</p>
